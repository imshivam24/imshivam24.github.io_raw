Hi! I’m a 3rd-year Ph.D. candidate in [Chemical Engineering](https://chemeng.iisc.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/), where I’m advised by Professor [Ananth Govind Rajan](https://chemeng.iisc.ac.in/faculty/ananth-govind-rajan/). I work at the interface of catalysis, computational chemistry, and machine learning. My research focuses on using density functional theory (DFT) to uncover the atomic-level mechanisms that drive catalytic reactions, with the aim of designing next-generation catalysts for sustainable chemical processes. I'm also passionate about integrating physics-based insights with modern machine learning techniques to solve complex materials challenges more efficiently. I enjoy working on problems that combine deep theoretical understanding with real-world impact, and I’m always curious about how emerging technologies can reshape the future of chemical engineering.
