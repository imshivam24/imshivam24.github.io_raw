Hi! I’m a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate in Chemical Engineering of Indian Institute of Science, where I’m advised by professor Ananth Govind Rajan. I work at the interface of catalysis, computational chemistry, and machine learning. My research focuses on using density functional theory (DFT) to uncover the atomic-level mechanisms that drive catalytic reactions, with the aim of designing next-generation catalysts for sustainable chemical processes. I'm also passionate about integrating physics-based insights with modern machine learning techniques to solve complex materials challenges more efficiently. I enjoy working on problems that combine deep theoretical understanding with real-world impact, and I’m always curious about how emerging technologies can reshape the future of chemical engineering.

# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture # in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` # property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page]#(/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
